# Description
This project analyzes two different models using the CKA (Centered Kernel Alignment) metric. It serves as the final project for the LLM
course at the University of Tehran (UT), focusing on evaluating models in line with the methodology
from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10939). Our primary goal is to investigate the impact of general knowledge subtraction on 
the base model.

In this project, we apply both the Arrow method and general knowledge subtraction models to the Wiki Dataset 
to explore how these techniques influence the general knowledge encoded in large language models.
# Usage
We develop our code in a modular fashion, but run the scripts in a Colab environment.
To get started, please review the [Guidance file](Guidance ), and copy the installation instructions into the first cell of your Jupyter note

# Examples
For a usage example, please refer to the code provided in the main.py file.
